      "I'm a Principal Software Developer with over 23 years of experience, and I still love coding, especially when it involves tackling complex problems and collaborating with teams. From high-level design to getting into the nitty-gritty of the code, I enjoy working through the tough questions, whether it's defining domain boundaries or optimizing architecture.",
      "I'm passionate about crypto/blockchain, domain-driven design, event-driven systems, and patterns like sagas and the transactional outbox. While ChatGPT might be quicker at cranking out CRUD stacks, I believe my real value comes in balancing the trade-offs, working with people, and finding the right solutions—together.",
      "I like to keep things light and fun, but I'm serious about delivering quality. Whether it's diving into code reviews or process improvements, I aim for a balance of high standards and practical solutions."
