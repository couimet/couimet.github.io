summary: "Bringing the Millow project to February 2025"
---

This project is a step-by-step modernization of [`millow`](https://github.com/dappuniversity/millow), a decentralized real estate marketplace DApp created in October 2022. The goal is to update dependencies, improve the codebase, and adopt best practices with the latest Ethereum development tools.

Built on top of my [`step_by_step_progress`](https://github.com/couimet/millow/tree/step_by_step_progress#readme) project, this version introduces several improvements to ensure compatibility with modern Ethereum development tools.

## Key Updates in This Project

### Dependencies & Compatibility
- Updated dependencies to the latest versions and removed unused ones
- Upgraded `Solidity` to version `0.8.28`
- Refactored code to work with the latest Ethereum development tools

### Testing & Deployment
- Updated unit tests to use Hardhat's fixtures instead of `beforeEach()` blocks
- Refactored the Hardhat deployment script to use [Ignition Modules](https://hardhat.org/ignition/docs/getting-started#overview)

### Miscellaneous Improvements
- Various minor enhancements for readability, maintainability, and performance
